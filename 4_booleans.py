"""
Booleans are a data type that can hold one of two values: True or False. 
They are often used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program. 
"""

# You can store a boolean in a variable like this:
my_boolean = True

# You can also store the result of a comparison in a variable:
a = 10
b = 5
result = a > b
print(result)
# What is the value of result?


# Can you print the value of if a = b?

# Can you print the value of if a > b?

# How do you check if a is not equal to b?


# Can we do this for strings? 
# Does "hi" equal "hi"?

# Does "Hello" equal "hello"?
