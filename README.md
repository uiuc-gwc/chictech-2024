You can use GitHub Codespaces to instantly create a development environment in the cloud. 
For us, this means you can code on any device by just logging into Github and running code. 
This is an easy way to get students started without worrying about installation and setup. 

## Setting Up a GitHub Codespace

1. **Open Codespaces**: Click on the `Code` button located at the top right of the repository file list.

2. **Create Codespace**: In the dropdown, select the `Codespaces` tab, then click on `New codespace`.

3. **Wait for Setup**: GitHub will now create your codespace. This may take a few minutes.

4. **Start Coding**: Once the codespace is ready, you can start coding directly in your browser.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [GitHub Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).
